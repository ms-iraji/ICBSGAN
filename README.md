## Abstract

Semi-supervised learning techniques leverage both labeled and unlabeled images to enhance classification performance in scenarios where labeled images are limited. However, challenges, such as determining appropriate thresholds, integrating incorrect pseudo-labels, and establishing effective consistency in augmentations, hinder the effectiveness of existing methods. Additionally, label prediction fluctuations on low-confidence images and their impact on generalization performance pose further limitations. This research introduces a novel framework, named interpolation consistency for bad semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (ICBSGAN) which addresses the limitations of semi-supervised learning through a new loss function. The proposed model combines bad adversarial training, fusion techniques, and regularization to enhance semi-supervised learning. ICBSGAN incorporates three types of interpolation consistency training: interpolation of bad fake images, real and bad fake images, and unlabeled images. The regularization techniques improve the generalization and the generation of diverse fake images as support vectors in low-density areas. It demonstrates linear behavior at interpolation, reducing fluctuations in predictions, improving stability, and the identification of decision boundaries. Experimental evaluations on the CIFAR-10, CINIC-10, MNIST, and SVHN datasets showcase the effectiveness of ICBSGAN compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach achieves notable improvements in error rate from 2.87 to 1.47 on MNIST, 3.89 to 3.13 on SVHN, and 15.48 to 9.59 on CIFAR-10 using 1000 labeled training images. Additionally, it reduces the error rate from 22.11 to 18.40 on CINIC-10 when using 700 labeled images per class.
